# POTA Activation at Neligh Mill US-3374 with Xiegu G90

**Meta Description**: POTA activation at Neligh Mill (US-3374) on May 9, 2025, using a Xiegu G90 and EFRW antenna on 20m SSB. Logged 13 contacts despite RF noise. Includes setup details and contact log.

On May 9, 2025, I activated Neligh Mill State Historic Site (US-3374) in Nebraska for Parks On The Air (POTA) as part of a Mother’s Day trip to surprise my mom and my wife Heather’s mom. This post covers my setup, results, and challenges during the activation.

## Setup and Location
Neligh Mill (US-3374), a historic site in northeast Nebraska, was my operating spot. I set up near the mill under a tree to escape the 90-degree heat. My rig was a Xiegu G90 at 20 watts, feeding a 41’ end-fed random wire (EFRW) on an Explorer POTA33H mast. The EFRW was quick to deploy, with a single counterpoise and a 9:1 unun for matching on 20m.

## Operating on 20m SSB
I operated exclusively on 20m SSB, logging 13 contacts in about an hour. The band was stable, with one notable DX contact to Canada. Powerline noise was a significant issue, with S5-S7 QRM making weak signals tough to copy. I’m considering learning CW or using digital modes like FT8 for future activations to mitigate noise.

## Challenges and Notes
- **RF Noise**: High-voltage powerlines near the mill caused persistent QRM. Next time, I’ll position the antenna farther from utilities.
- **Weather**: Early May heat hit 90°F, requiring frequent breaks and hydration.
- **Local Interaction**: Met Harv, the caretaker since 1987. He was likely there during my childhood field trip to the mill, adding a nostalgic touch to the day.
- **Context**: The activation was part of a Mother’s Day surprise visit, combining ham radio with family time.

## Conclusion
The Neligh Mill POTA activation was a solid outing despite RF noise, with 13 contacts and a memorable Canada DX QSO. The Xiegu G90 and EFRW performed well, but I’m motivated to explore CW or digital modes for noisy environments. Meeting Harv and tying this to a Mother’s Day trip made it special.
